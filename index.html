    <h2>Get To Know Me</h2>
    <p>I have always had a tendency to gravitate towards what is not expected of me. I want to make a statement, but I want that statement to better the world.<br>When looking for a career, I was very particular about choosing a path that I could use to create change.<br>Most would not immediately think of coding as my obvious career choice and neither did I.<br>After finding so many inspiring tech companies dedicated towards using programming for good; from addressing human rights to environmental solutions, I was ready to take the leap. <br>
    I completed the Full-Stack Web Developer program at Thinkful where I became proficient in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML/CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
    </ul>
    <p> and other associated frameworks including Node.js, React, jQuery, and PostgreSQL.</p>
